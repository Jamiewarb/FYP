\abstract
Code sharing and reuse has been around since the advent of programming itself; though despite such longevity, code reuse is not a solved problem. There is no obvious solution; no concrete methodology. Small scale code reuse can often mean developers storing snippets in arbitrary folder structures on their local machine. These code snippets are static, not subject to peer review or critique; they're only as good as the original developer that wrote them; they are likely to become outdated. We feel that collaboration is the key to solving these problems with code reuse. Shnip It is a collaborative system that excels in small scale code reuse by allowing developers the tools they need to maintain and critique code snippets in a collaborative and dynamic environment, preventing stale code and promoting quality snippets. Shnip It is a step towards better code reuse.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I must thank my study participants, whom without, this dissertation would have no footing on which to stand.

Furthermore, I thank Leon Watts for second-assessing this project, and providing critical analysis during the first demonstration, helping define the project.

I'd like to thank friends and family for guidance through dark times, and giving me the strength to continue when I was overwhelmed and grief stricken. Without your shoulders to lean on, this endeavour would perhaps have been in vain.

And finally, the greatest thanks of all must go to my supervisor, Fabio Nemetz. Throughout this project, he has endeavoured to assist me in every way possible, despite his own work load and personal commitments. 
It is with his endless encouragement that this dissertation comes to fruition, and his constant support, that I am so deeply grateful for.
